We found we ask ourselves similar questions every time we want to start a project with a new language:

- _&ldquo;How do I install the language runtime?&rdquo;_
- _&ldquo;How does a basic directory structure look like?&rdquo;_
- _&ldquo;What tools do I need to get started?&rdquo;_
- &hellip;

This is our attempt to help other people that might face similar struggles.

We do not provide tutorials on how to get started with a language itself.
There are many great resources out there already in a level of quality we would never be able to achieve.
So we're linking out to the ones we know.
If you think we're missing resources worth mentioning please don't hestitate to raise an issue or pull request on our <a href="https://github.com/vanilla-project/vanilla-project.github.io">github repository</a>.

The guides we provide are opiniated in the way we think a project _should_ be structured.
That doesn't mean it's the best way to structure a project but a way we've seen and successfully implemented ourselves in the past.
