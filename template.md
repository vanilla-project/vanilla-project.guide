_Please provide a brief language introduction here._
_You can mention the language's origins, strength, etc._
_This should include language specific features, too!_
_Think of Go's channels, Elixir's &ldquo;Let it crash&rdquo; philosophy and so on._

_Pretty much what you'd read on the box of the language if you were to see it on the shelf of a supermarket._


## Further Material

- _A link to the official docs can be provided here._
- _But really list resources you think are worth sharing._


## Topics, Tools and Terms

_Explain some general terminology that's being used in the community here._


### Dependency Management

_If the language has support for (automated) dependency management this subchapter is a good place to explain how it is done for the given language._


### Version Managers

_If there are tools for managing different version provide possibilities here._
_Especially if there's more than one tool for that._


### Testing Tools

_Maybe the language comes with testing support built-in, maybe we need separate dependencies here._
_This subchapter is a great place to explain different tools for different testing approaches!_


## Directory Structure

_Every language has either an expected layout or at least the community agreed on a common way to organize projects._

<ul class="directory-structure">
  <li class="directory">src</li>
  <li class="directory">test</li>
  <li class="file">main.file</li>
</ul>


## Tests

_If applicable for the given language and project type we should also explain different testing strategies._
_Like approaches to unit-, controller-, integration- and acceptance-testing._

_This does not always apply, so feel free to remove that subchapter if that is the case._
_For example if the guide is about a command-line program, explaining how to test controllers isn't really possible._
_Whereas if the guide focusses on a web-framework in a given language, it might be worthwhile explaining a controler- and acceptance-testing approach._


## Example Project

_Every guide should come with an example repository that has working code to demonstrate a basic setup._
_Ideally there's a simple unit test available as well to demonstrate how to test with the language._


### Run the Application

_Provide instructions to run the actual application._


### Run the Tests

_Show how to run the tests and if needed explain how different moving parts fit together._
_Different testing strategies can be explained, too!_
